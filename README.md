## ✍️ Development Process

### 🤠 My API Playground
Eager to dive into APIs and Redux Toolkit, I chose to build Cryptoverse as my testbed. I started by exploring RapidAPI for free data sources and crafting a clean layout, complete with smooth routing and a robust Redux store. The homepage serves as a launchpad, offering glimpses into the Cryptocurrencies and News pages.

### 😵 Cryptocurrency Showcase
On the Cryptocurrencies page, I showcased 100 digital coins in all their glory. The Cryptodetails page dives deeper, revealing each coin's historical price charts powered by Chart.js, thanks to inspiration from JavaScript Mastery. The News page features a dynamic feed with filters to keep you updated on specific coins. Finally, the Exchange page provides a one-stop shop for all trading needs, displaying exchange options and stats for every crypto.

### 😀 The Journey
This project was a wild ride, with every API challenge and Redux puzzle making it worth the effort. Adding PWA functionality was the cherry on top, allowing users to install Cryptoverse as a mobile app and access it offline, enhancing the user experience.

## 📲 Progressive Web App (PWA)
Cryptoverse is not just a web app; it's also a PWA! This means you can install it on your mobile device and enjoy offline access, giving you the convenience of a native app-like experience. This feature makes it easier to stay updated with the latest in the crypto world, even when you're on the go.
