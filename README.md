## ✍️ Process

🤠 My API playground: Eager to get my hands dirty with APIs and Redux Toolkit, I decided to build a crypto app as my testbed. First, I scoured RapidAPI for free data sources and crafted a clean layout, complete with slick routing and a trusty Redux store. The homepage served as a launchpad, offering glimpses into the Cryptocurrencies and News pages.

😵 Next, I tackled the Cryptocurrencies page, showcasing 100 digital coins in all their glory. But I didn't stop there! The Cryptodetails page unveiled each coin's hidden depths, including mesmerizing historical price charts powered by Chart.js (thanks Javascript Mastery). News was another beast, and I built a dynamic feed with a handy filter, letting you zero in on the latest buzz around specific coins. Finally, the Exchange page rounded things off, displaying exchange options and stats for every crypto – a one-stop shop for all your trading needs.

😀 This project was a wild ride, but every API hurdle and Redux puzzle I conquered made it worth it.
